                            <h3 class="n-h4">Where does the information come from?</h3>
                            <p class="n-padding-t-15">The information about brokers and brokerage firms that you find in advisor check comes from the Central Registration depository and also the self declaration made by them. All brokers must be licensed and registered by various regulatory authorities in India as well as globally wherever they are practicing financial advisory. Information is obtained through the forms that brokers, brokerage firms and regulators complete as part of their registration and licensing process. D&B obtains this after the advisors confirm to be verified and certified.</p>
                            <p class="n-padding-b-15">The information about investment advisory firms and representatives comes from the specific registration databases disclosed by the advisor after they give their confirmation to verify.</p>
