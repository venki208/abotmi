                        Yes. As described in <b>Section 1.4 of our Privacy Policy,</b> we use cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses Abotmi has the best possible experience. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy.

                      A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables Abotmi features and functionality. For example, cookies enable us to identify your device, secure your access to Abotmi and our sites generally, and even help us know if someone attempts to access your account from a different device. Cookies also enable you to easily share content on Abotmi and help us serve relevant ads to you.

                        We use cookies on our sites (such as abotmi.com and slideshare.net) and mobile applications. Any browser visiting these sites will receive cookies from us. We also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-Abotmi sites that host our plugins (for example, Abotmi  “Share” button) or tags.

                    <p>
                        We use two types: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to Abotmi  or interact with our services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by Abotmi  when you return to one of our sites or a partner site that uses our services (for example, our sharing or job application buttons). Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

                        Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit Abotmi , remember your preferences, and give you a personalized experience that’s in line with your settings. Cookies also make your interactions with Abotmi  faster and more secure. Additionally, cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Abotmi  sites, and bring customized features to you through Abotmi  plugins such as our “Share” button.

                    <p>
                        DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been made, it has been slow. No standard has been adopted to this date. As such, Abotmi  does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.

                        Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. Note: Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by Abotmi  may also set third party cookies.
